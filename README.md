# screws_bolts_detector
A small desktop that detects screws and bolts via Machine learning
Bolts, Nuts and screws detector, and old project using classical image processing techniques, actually it's a fun project, and I enjoyed refactoring it.


I have added minor changes to the original code:

Splitting it into classes and adding Gaussian filter, I'm planning to do more refactoring to the code and add Loggers, Cache and so on, in the current time u can enjoy the code and please note that I don't own any thing regarding the base code, the code was part of "OpenCV By example" by:

Prateek Joshi
David Millan Escriva
Vinicius Godoy

*Note: It's not complete yet, only feature extraction and image preprocessing are complete, but as I don't work on it often, I preferred to share it with u, but it compiles without errors xD xD
